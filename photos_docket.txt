What needs to be done for PHOTOS:

Design a UML based on our GUI storyboard\
Create fxml files as close to the GUI storyboard as possible for each of our stages/pages\

From there-
Follow UML as close as possible:
	starting with admin subsyste
	stock photos
	basic user functionality
		Create album
		remove photo
		caption/recaption a photo
		display photo in separate display area
		Add a tag to a photo
		Delete a tag from a photo
		Copy a photo from one album to another
		Move a photo from one album to another
		(manual slideshow)
		Search for photos
			by date range
			by type-value pairs
				single tag - person == sesh
				double tag(person == sesh AND location == Prague)
				double tag (person == sesh OR location == Prague)
				should be able to create an album with these searchresults			

	more complex  - need to serialized the state of the photos app when its closed so that it looks the same upon reloading the photos and loggiing in as the same person
